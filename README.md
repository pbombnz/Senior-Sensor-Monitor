# Senior Senor Monitor

This Application designed for Web and Mobile communicates with motion sensors via IoT communication protocol, MQTT, to determine where the elder is within a home, and whether they are active or not in terms of long periods of inactivity. It is quite naive, and does not account for external factors (such as house parties wiht multiple guest, the elder leaving the house etc.), although this has been dicussed in detail within my report and was out of scope of the university assignment.

This may not work when executed due to removal of remote server URL. Its purely meant to demostrate the uses of MQTT.
